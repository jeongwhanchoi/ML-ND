In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "### Implementation: Feature Relevance\n",
    "One interesting thought to consider is if one (or more) of the six product categories is actually relevant for understanding customer purchasing. That is to say, is it possible to determine whether customers purchasing some amount of one category of products will necessarily purchase some proportional amount of another category of products? We can make this determination quite easily by training a supervised regression learner on a subset of the data with one feature removed, and then score how well that model can predict the removed feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the code block below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Assign `new_data` a copy of the data by removing a feature of your choice using the `DataFrame.drop` function.\n",
    " - Use `sklearn.cross_validation.train_test_split` to split the dataset into training and testing sets.\n",
    "   - Use the removed feature as your target label. Set a `test_size` of `0.25` and set a `random_state`.\n",
    " - Import a decision tree regressor, set a `random_state`, and fit the learner to the training data.\n",
    " - Report the prediction score of the testing set using the regressor's `score` function."

Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data.

However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. *How can the wholesale distributor use the customer segments to determine which customers, if any, would react positively to the change in delivery service?*  \n",
